Dear {{{TITLE}}}{{{HR}}},

I was excited to hear about your recent opening in {{{POSITION}}} at {{{COMPANY}}}. I believe I will be your valuable assets because my master's degree in accounting and problem-solving skills for taxation and bookkeeping issues strongly correlate with the requirements {{{COMPANY}}} is seeking. 

Passed the VITA training and exams with top-ranked scores, I worked as an IRS volunteer income tax assistant at CEDC. I conducted on average 8 interviews per week, identified Form W-2, 1099-R, etc., and determined their financial status to help clients with tax returns. 

Previously, as a staff accountant at GF Securities Co., Ltd., I maintained ledgers and compiled company financial statements. My responsibilities included processing payroll, reconcilateing bank statements, and resolving payment issues. I initiated an income and expense flux analysis for the first working month, which provided for early identification and correction of posting errors, and contributed to accelerating the month-end close to the twentieth calendar day of every month. 

In an academic project, I analyzed annual reports of American Eagle and Urban Outfitters. By computing over 10 crucial finance indicators, I accurately evaluated the profit and operation stability and predicted stock price trends in the following two years.

Studing in Spain as an exchange student and coming to the US to pursue a master's degree in accounting are great turning points in my life. The experience of growing up in the multicultural environments extends my relationships with people from different bankgrounds and  
improves the ability to collaborate and work on teams with excellent interpersonal skills.

I am proficient in accounting software, including MS Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and various other tax and accounting related software.

Proactive, hardworking, and team-oriented, I am eager to apply my well-rounded skills and proven track record of professional achievements to this position at {{{COMPANY}}}. Thank you for taking your time to review the enclosed resume. I look forward to discussing with you more opportunities I can bring to {{{COMPANY}}}.

Sincerely,
