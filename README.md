Dear {{{TITLE}}}{{{HR}}},

I was excited to hear about your recent opening in {{{POSITION}}} at {{{COMPANY}}}. 
I believe I will be your valuable assets because my master degree in accounting,  and problem-solving skill for taxation issues and general bookkeeping, and financial accounting experiences strongly correlate with the requirements {{{COMPANY}}} is seeking. 

Passed the VITA exams with top-ranked scores, I worked as an volunteer income tax assistant at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). I conducted on average six interviews per week and examined Form W-2, 1099-R, etc. to helped clients with tax status and tax return reports. 

Previously, as a staff accountant at GF Securities Co., Ltd., I maintained ledgers and compiled company financial statements. My responsibilities include invoice processing, document coordination, revamping systems for accuracy and efficiency, and resolving discrepancies and payment issues promptly. I initiated an income and expense flux analysis for the first working day of the month that provides for early identification and correction of posting errors, and contributed to accelerating the month-end close to the twentieth calendar day of every month. 

In an academic project, I analyzed annual reports of American Eagle and Urban Outfitters. By computing over ten crucial finance indicators, I accurately evaluated the profit and operation stability and predicted stock price trends in the following two years.

I am proficient in accounting software, including but not limited to, MS Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and various other tax and accounting related software. Proactive, hardworking, and team-oriented, I am eager to apply my well-rounded skills and proven track record of professional achievements to this position at {{{COMPANY}}}.

Going to Spain as an exchange student and coming to the United States to pursue a master's degree in accounting are major turning points in my life, forcing me to step out of my comfort zone.

Thank you for taking your time to review the enclosed resume. I look forward to discussing with you more opportunities I can bring to {{{COMPANY}}}.

Sincerely,  
Lijun Chen
